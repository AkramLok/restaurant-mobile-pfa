# Backend (Spring Boot API) - Restaurant Management System
This repository contains the backend API for the Restaurant Management System, developed with Spring Boot. It handles all the core functionalities of the system, including managing restaurant data, orders, promotions, and user accounts. The API serves both the mobile app (for clients and servers) and the web app (for restaurant owners).

## Key Features
- User Management: Manage user accounts for admins, servers, and clients.
- Order Management: Handle order creation, updates, and tracking for customers.
- Loyalty System: Implement a points-based loyalty system where customers can earn and redeem rewards.
- Promotions & Offers: Allow admins to create and manage special promotions for loyal customers.
- Menu Management: Add, update, and delete menu items.
- Security: Role-based access control (RBAC) using Spring Security to secure endpoints for different actors (Admin, Server, Client).
## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot: For building a RESTful API.
- MySQL: For the database (configurable based on setup).
- Spring Security: For authentication and authorization.
- JPA/Hibernate: For database interactions and object-relational mapping.
